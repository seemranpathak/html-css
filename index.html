                <h1>Missile Man of India</h1>
                <p>
                  <strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </strong>15 October 1931 â€“
                  president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
                  Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering.
                  He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science
                  administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
                  Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and
                  was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and
                  military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as
                  the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic
                  missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a
                  pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
                  Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear
                  test by India in 1974.
